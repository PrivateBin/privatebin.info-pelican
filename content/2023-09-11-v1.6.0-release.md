Summary: This release adds translations for Japanese & Arabic and increases the minimal required PHP version to 7.3.

**This release adds translations for Japanese & Arabic and increases the minimal required PHP version to 7.3.**

In addition to the two new translations for the Japanese & Arabic languages, the Email-button is now a configurable option, but still enabled by default.

The minimum supported PHP version is now 7.3, due to having upgraded the PHP unit test framework which no longer supports older PHP releases. This simplifies our development (we no longer need to maintain a parallel branch that ensured PHP 8 compatibility) and let us drop a library that provided a more cryptographically secure random function to PHP 5.

## Update procedure

As usual, you can [download the archive](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/releases/latest) for a manual upgrade and can find more details in the [installation instructions](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/blob/master/INSTALL.md#installation).

We also offer a [container images using the nginx web server with php-fpm](https://hub.docker.com/r/privatebin/nginx-fpm-alpine/) and one using the [nginx unit application server](https://hub.docker.com/r/privatebin/unit-alpine/), that include the recommended secure setup with the non-essential files and data outside of the web servers document root.

## Changes since version 1.5.2

* ADDED: Translations for Japanese & Arabic
* ADDED: Configuration option to disable Email button (#1164)
* CHANGED: Minimum required PHP version is 7.3, due to upgrading PHPunit (#707)
* CHANGED: Removed PHP 5 polyfill for random_bytes()

## Help wanted & greatly appreciated

Apart from the large tasks that require deeper insight and time, there are also [smaller issues were help is wanted](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22), topics [open to debate](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22discuss+me%22+) and of course many languages that still remain to be [translated](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Translation). We are also still looking for additional long term maintainers among our frequent issue helpers.

What can we offer you in return for your help?

* We can offer you our mentorship, if this is your first time participating as a maintainer of an open source software project. We can guide you through submitting your first pull requests and work with you to ensure your change fulfills the communities quality standards, gets merged and makes it into a release.
* Your work gets publicly credited. This can help you build up a resume, showing off your growing skill set, in programming as well as your soft skills.
* PrivateBin is a smaller project. If you'd like to learn how to participate and contribute in an open source git project, this should be less overwhelming then larger projects.
* We do have a decent unit test code coverage, so it is an environment forgiving of mistakes. You may still introduce logical flaws or issues in new features, not yet covered in the tests, but you can rely on the tests preventing any regressions in other areas.
* You don't have to be proficient in multiple programming languages, there are a lot of things to improve within either the JavaScript or PHP areas that don't need you to understand the other side, beyond their shared API.
* It can be an opportunity to learn about continuos integration tools to automate tasks like tests, security scans, etc.

If you are interested in helping with any of these points, we have prepared a [development guide](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Development) including design goals, code structure and tools to get you started. For any questions, you can chat with the maintainers in the [discussion](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/discussions) area or reach us via [email](mailto:support@privatebin.org).
