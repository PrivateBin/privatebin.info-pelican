PrivateBin comes with multiple templates and of course you can also create your own to adjust the look of it to your site.

### bootstrap

This is a [bootstrap CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/) based PrivateBin template and the default as of 0.20:

![bootstrap PrivateBin template]({static}/img/1.0/bootstrap.png)


### bootstrap-compact

This is a slightly modified template based on the bootstrap one above. It moves some options into a drop down and the navigation floats fixed to the top, even when scrolling down:

![bootstrap-compact PrivateBin template]({static}/img/1.0/bootstrap-compact.png)


### bootstrap-page

Not everybody liked the order of the "New" and "Send" buttons so they were switched for usability reasons. For those preferring the order as in the classic "page"-template there is this bootstrap CSS based theme:

![bootstrap PrivateBin template]({static}/img/1.0/bootstrap-page.png)


### bootstrap-dark

Based on the [darkstrap](https://github.com/danneu/darkstrap) bootstrap CSS theme, this is a dark PrivateBin template:

![bootstrap PrivateBin template]({static}/img/1.0/bootstrap-dark.png)


### bootstrap-dark-page

Not everybody liked the order of the "New" and "Send" buttons so they were switched for usability reasons. For those preferring the order as in the classic "page"-template there is this [darkstrap](https://github.com/danneu/darkstrap) based theme:

![bootstrap PrivateBin template]({static}/img/1.0/bootstrap-dark-page.png)
