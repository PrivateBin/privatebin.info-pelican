Summary: This release improves the safety of the SVG attachment preview, adds Google Cloud Storage and Oracle database support, and new translations.

**This release improves the safety of the SVG attachment preview, adds Google Cloud Storage and Oracle database support, and new translations.**

This minor release addresses a security issue with the SVG attachment preview, adds support for Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and Oracle databases, adds four new languages to the translations and includes updated libraries.

The storage system got reworked as part of the new Google Cloud Storage class and when not using the default file storage, the server salt and purge and traffic limiter items are now stored as part of the selected storage backend. It is now possible to run PrivateBin with database or GCS backend without requiring any write access to the data directory - automatic migrations run the first time any of these get accessed and found to be still present in the filesystem.

## Benefits of switching to the new release

We recommend to upgrade 1.3.x instances to improve the resolved security issues. At the very minimum, please update your CSP headers in the configuration file to our currently recommended settings. You can check the headers of your instance via our new [instance check service](https://privatebin.info/directory/check).

## Update procedure

As usual, you can [download the archive](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/releases/latest) for a manual upgrade and can find more details in the [installation instructions](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/blob/master/INSTALL.md#installation).

We also offer a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/privatebin/nginx-fpm-alpine/) that includes the recommended secure setup with the non-essential files and data outside of the web servers document root.

## Help wanted & greatly appreciated

Apart from the large tasks that require deeper insight and time, there are also [smaller issues were help is wanted](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22), topics [open to debate](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22discuss+me%22+) and of course many languages that still remain to be [translated](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Translation). We are also still looking for additional long term maintainers among our frequent issue helpers.

If you are interested in helping with any of these points, we have prepared a [development guide](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Development) including design goals, code structure and tools that should get you started.

## Plans for future releases

The next regular release will focus on [user interface improvements](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/milestone/6).
